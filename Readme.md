# üé¨ Personalized Movie Recommender System

A real-time, personalized movie recommender system built with Python and Streamlit. This application demonstrates how to solve the "cold start" problem by allowing a new user to rate movies and instantly receive tailored recommendations based on a pre-trained Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is organized into several key files:

-   `model_training.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for training the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model from the MovieLens 25M dataset.
-   `process-poster.py`: A Python script that queries The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch poster URLs for each movie.
-   `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file that loads the pre-trained model and serves the interactive user interface.
-   `artifacts/`: This directory stores the output of the model training‚Äîthe final user/movie vectors and biases.
-   `data/`: This directory stores the raw and processed movie data, including the final `movies_with_posters.csv`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system
```

**2. Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies:**
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Download Model Artifacts with Git LFS:**
This project uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) for the model and data files.
```bash
# First-time setup for Git LFS
git lfs install

# Download the large model and data files
git lfs pull
```
